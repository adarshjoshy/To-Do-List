## Pomodoro Technique
**Source :** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique<br>
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. 
The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. 
Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo 
used as a university student.<br>
